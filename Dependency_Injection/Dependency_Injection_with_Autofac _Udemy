Dependency Injection with Autofac - Udemy

The following file is a list of notes taken from following the course `Dependency Injection in C# and .NET with the Autofac Library` on Udemy 
(https://www.udemy.com/course/di-ioc-dotnet)

Section 0: Introduction

- In an Object Oriented system:
	- Components often depend on one another
	- Want to manage dependencies and easily substitute components
	- Want the system to be extensible

Section 1: Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control

- Car car = new Car(new Engine());
  car.Go(); // uses engine

- Car depends on Engine
	-> engine is a dependency

- Manually supplying Engine to Car is not great
	- You have to do it correctly in every place you create a car
	- Engine might have it's own dependency
	- A component might have a large number of dependencies

- Dependency Injection
	- No need to make use of the 'new' Keyword
	- Deep dependency trees are resolved

	- How does it work?
		- Still put all dependencies as a constructor arguments (Constructor injection)
		- Configure a container to satisfy dependencies in a particular way
		- Use container to initialize a component, including all of it's dependencies

	- Advantages:
		- Less boilerplate code
		- One central place where everything is configured
		- Can externalize configuration
		- Allows for simple lifetime control

	- Disadvantages:
		- Creates an expectation that configuration is done by construction code.
		- Behaviour separated from constructor makes code a bit difficult to read/follow
		- Requires up-front development effort
		- Can cause an explosion of types (especially interfaces)

- Inversion of Control (IoC):
	- Inverts the control flow of a program
	  	-> For example:
	  		- Ordinary control: myList.Add(42); // container -> operation -> object
	  		- Inverted control: 42.AddTo(myList); // object -> operation -> container

	- DI implements IoC:
		- Instead of using ordinary object composition
			-> you delegate that to the IoC container
				-> telling the container how you want the object to be built
